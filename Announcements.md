## Welcome to MTH314: Matrix Algebra I: with computational applications


Hello MTH314 students,

We are excited to be teaching MTH314 this Spring and look forward to meeting all of you in class next week. This semester is unique since, due to new university COVID policies, we will not be meeting the first week of class. 

Instead the first week will be used for reading, review and semester preparation.  To this end, it is required that all students complete the following tasks before showing up for the first day of class.  NOTE: failure to complete these tasks will be reflected in your course participation grade. 

Since this course will also taught with all sections "in-sync" and since there is no class on Monday (Due to MLK) our first day of class will either be **_Wednesday January 20th_** (for MW sections) or **_Thursday January 21st_** (for TTh sections) in order to keep the sections on the same basic schedule.

To help with the first week tasks, some office hours will be provided.  Please see the office hour schedule on the course website and feel free to stop by to just introduce yourself or ask a question about the first week class.

**_Task 1 - Syllabus and Course Review_**

To start, I suggest that you watch the following video and review the course Syllabus. Note that this video is much longer than most of the videos you will find in the class.  You will probably be fine if you speed up the video and you can probably just listen to most of it.

**_Task 2 - Student Background Review_**

Students in MTH314 come from a variety of backgrounds.  To help the instructor adjust the curriculum and provide support to all students in this course please fill out the following on-line survey:

**_Task 3 - Get Jupyter working_**

We will be using Jupyter notebooks for most of our student/instructor communication. Please attend class with the latest version of Anaconda Python installed on your computer (Anaconda includes Jupyter). Instructions for installing and using Anaconda and Jupyter can be found here:

- [0000--Jupyter-Getting-Started-Guide.html](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/mth314-F20-student/assignments/0000--Jupyter-Getting-Started-Guide.html)

As a backup, all students are also given accounts on the MSU jupyterhub servers [http://jupyterhub.egr.msu.edu](http://jupyterhub.egr.msu.edu) and [http://jupyterhub2.egr.msu.edu](http://jupyterhub2.egr.msu.edu).  Make sure you follow the directions in the above "getting started guide" and ensure that you can login and use both jupyterhub servers. 


**_Task 4 - Review Python libraries_**
In this class we will be using programming to teach linear algebra and therefore assume that everyone knows how to use python. the instructors provide the following reference as a review for the most common python libraries we expect you to be able to use for class (numpy, scipy, math, sympy, etc).  please review this tutorial to make sure you are properly prepared for class:

- [Python Library Review](assignments/00-Python_Packages.html)


**_Task 5 - Pre-class assignment_**

You are expected to come to class ready to complete the in-class assignments.  To prepare for most classes, students are required to complete pre-class assignments (typically two pre-class assignments per week).  These assignments will be in the form of jupyter notebooks and will include reading, videos and programming activities.  The required time for each pre-class will vary but the instructors have tried to make them take approximately 30-minutes.  

Each pre-class assignment ends with an online survey which students are required to complete in order to earn credit for the assignment.  Your first weeks assignments are available on the course git repository or downloadable from the course website.  At a minimum, you must complete the first pre-class assignment by 11:59pm on Tuesday January 19th.

## Welcome to MTH314: Matrix Algebra I: with computational applications


Hello MTH314 students,

We are excited to be teaching MTH314 this Spring and look forward to meeting all of you in class next week. Detailed information about the course, including the syllabus, announcements, schedule and assignments can be found on the course website (Bookmark this page!):

- [MTH314 Course Website](http://cmse.msu.edu/mth314)

This semester is unique since, due to new university COVID policies, we will not be meeting the first week of class. Instead the first week will be used for reading, review and semester preparation.  To this end, it is required that all students complete the tasks found in the following website:

- [00--Class_Prep-Checklist](00--Class_Prep-Checklist.ipynb)

NOTE: failure to complete these tasks will be reflected in your course participation grade. 

Since this course will also taught with all sections "in-sync" and since there is no class on Monday (Due to MLK) our first day of class will either be **_Wednesday January 20th_** (for MW sections) or **_Thursday January 21st_** (for TTh sections) in order to keep the sections on the same basic schedule.

To help with the first week tasks, some office hours will be provided.  Please see the office hour schedule on the course website and feel free to stop by to just introduce yourself or ask a question about the first week class. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Dirk Colbry 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTH314 Course Coordinator on behalf of all of the MTH314 course instructors
